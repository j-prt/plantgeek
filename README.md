### about
Full-stack live website built 100% by me - including concept, design, and implementation. Frontend built with React, backend built with Express, Node, and MongoDB. This app started as a full-stack solo coding project for school in 2021 and has since undergone major changes and improvements, particularly in the backend. It is currently an ongoing side project I work on in my free time.
